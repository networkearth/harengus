## A Series of Questions

#### Target Species 
[Atlantic Herring (*Clupea harengus*)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-herring)

#### Bycatch Species

>Atlantic Herring FMP and EIS 58 Fisheries Science Center has advised on a working hypothesis—that mid-water trawling for pelagic species will result in some marine mammal bycatch.

#### Biological Range

> Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus harengus) are distributed along the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to the Canadian Maritime provinces. Schools of adult herring undertake extensive migrations to areas where they feed, spawn and overwinter. Herring are found all along the coast in inshore and offshore waters to the edge of the continental shelf during late winter and early spring. Adult herring move north into the Gulf of Maine in the spring, and in the summer and fall they segregate into more or less discrete spawning aggregations. After spawning, the adults migrate south again. This changing seasonal distribution has given rise to both mobile and fixed gear fisheries which harvest herring of all age groups. The catch supplies domestic and foreign markets for juvenile and adult herring which are used for human consumption, bait and food for zoo animals. Adult herring undertake extensive seasonal movements, which have been best defined for the Georges Bank stock. Three phases are apparent: (1) a late summer-early autumn spawning migration of ripening fish; (2) a rapid post-spawning migration to warmer waters to the south for overwintering; and (3) a spring-early summer feeding migration. The Soviets followed adult herring from Georges Bank after spawning. They found that post-spawners moved southwest to off Chesapeake Bay in November and overwintered there. The larger and older fish seemed to Atlantic Herring FMP and EIS 115 move furthest south. Feeding migrations back to Georges Bank began in May or early June, and to shallower spawning sites on the northern edge in September. The waters off Cape Cod seemed to constitute a mixing area, with different groups passing at different times of the year. <sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup>

Knowing spawning grounds is especially important as herring form rather tight aggregations during this time which make them particularly vulnerable to fishing. 

>Some states, however, do not have the resources to implement and enforce the tolerance provision. As a result, if the Council did not adopt any spawning closures, it is possible that vessels could catch spawn herring in federal waters and land them in a state that is unable to enforce the Commission's provisions, preventing effective spawning protection. By adopting spawning closures in federal waters for the key areas and times of spawning activity, the Council's closures augment the efforts of the states to protect spawning herring.

>The relative proportion of the biomass of herring in each area during spawning season is estimated as 25% in the Gulf of Maine, 55% on Nantucket Shoals, and 20% on Georges Bank.

#### As Bycatch from Other Fisheries

>The plan does not restrict the landing of incidental catches of herring in other fisheries unless there is a spawning closure or effort controls in effect. In these instances, vessels are only allowed to possess up to 2,000 pounds of herring

#### Stock Biomass and Mortality<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup>

>Stock biomass for 1997 is estimated to be 2.9 million mt, 260% of BMSY. There is considerable uncertainty about current stock size, which could be overestimated. Fishing mortality in 1997 is estimated to be less than 0.1

> A conditioned surplus production model was used to estimate the maximum sustainable yield to be 317,000 mt. The biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and the fishing mortality rate at MSY (FMSY) were estimated to be 1.1 million mt and 0.30, with a carrying capacity (K) of 2.13 million mt and an intrinsic rate of population growth (r) of 0.60. 

> The SARC, however, in its review of the working group report, expressed concern over the application of a surplus stock production model (ASPIC) to estimate MSY for multiple stocks of herring.

> Based on geometric mean recruitment, the MSY values ranged from 108,000 mt to 290,000 mt depending on the time period used to determine average recruitment. The SARC recommended that it would not be prudent to consider MSY above 200,000 mt or BMSY to be above 1.5 million mt until the sizes of recent year classes were better estimated

> The SARC approach is highly dependent on the VPA estimates of recruitment (age 1 fish). All of the time periods that the SARC considered in computing average recruitment included 15 years when the stock was in a collapsed condition and therefore the YPR approach underestimates recruitment when the stock is at BMSY 

#### Growth<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup>

> Growth rates can vary greatly from stock to stock and from year to year. Some herring will mature by age-3, most will mature by age-5. Growth is highly variable and appears to be influenced by many factors, including temperature, food availability, and population size 

>  In fish up to three years old, growth was inversely related to population density, and was faster in western than in eastern Maine.

It seems like herring definitely exhibit density dependent growth which means that capturing a specific number of megatons each year could result in remarkably different numbers of herring being caught.

There also seems to be difference in growth and maximum size between inshore and offshore populations. 

#### Spawning

>Depending on their size and age, female herring can produce from 55,000 to 210,000 eggs

That's a huge difference in number!

> Egg predation and adverse environmental conditions often result in high egg mortalities.

>Larvae are about 4-10 mm (0.25 in) in length at hatching which occurs 10-15 days after the eggs are deposited on the bottom (Fahay 1983). The larvae remain pelagic through the winter in nearshore and estuarine waters in the Gulf of Maine (Chenoweth 1980; Chenoweth et al., 1989), and have been reported as far south as New Jersey

>Those juveniles which survive until the following spring and summer (age – 2) are harvested as sardines in the coastal fishery

>Mortality of Atlantic herring in the larval stage is very high since the larvae remain vulnerable to very low temperatures and a limited food supply for a prolonged period during the winter, especially in the shallow nearshore and estuarine waters (Townsend and Graham 1981, Graham et al. 1991). Campbell and Graham (1991) developed an ecological model in order to examine which factors affected larval survival to the early juvenile stage.

>When larval survival is above a threshold, density-dependent predation on brit can reduce year-class size

<img style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;" src="{{environment}}/static/spawning_distribution.png" />

>The location and movement of juvenile Atlantic herring which originate from spawning on Georges Bank is not known with any certainty

>Juvenile herring do not typically appear in survey catches

>The most compelling evidence supporting the existence of separate Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank/Nantucket Shoals stocks was the collapse of the large Georges Bank/Nantucket Shoals stock in the early 1970s after several years of heavy exploitation by foreign fishing fleets. This stock remained in a depressed state for about ten years, during which time the smaller Gulf of Maine stock continued to support a strong coastal fishery. 

>Fall trawl survey data can not be used because they are too variable from tow to tow, the result of the aggregation of adults in certain locations during the spawning season

>Larval survey data collected every year between 1971 and 1994 were used in the past as a second tuning index for the VPA, but are no longer available since NMFS larval herring surveys were discontinued in 1994.


#### Feeding<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup>

>Atlantic herring are visual feeders, consuming plankton during daylight hours (Blaxter 1966), filtering out small organisms with long, well-developed gill rakers. Young herring begin to feed on small phytoplankton, eating larger organisms as they grow. Fingerlings or larger-size herring (brit) consume large quantities of copepods. Adult herring feed heavily on the euphausiid crustacean Meganyctiphanes norvegica, but may also eat copepods, fish eggs, pteropods, mollusk larvae and the larvae of small fish such as sand lance, silversides, herring and capelin

#### Predation<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup> 

>Juvenile herring, especially brit (age-1 juveniles) are preyed upon heavily due to their abundance and small size

>Overholtz et al. (1991) also calculated that five species of whales, three species of dolphins, harbor porpoises and harbor seals consumed, on average, 19,300 mt (42.5 million lbs) of herring a year from 1988-92

>A review of the stomach contents of 95 harbor porpoise caught in gillnets in the Gulf of Maine during the fall from 1989-1994 showed that herring occurred in 78% of non-calf stomachs and contributed 44% of ingested mass, the largest proportion of any species

>These calculations indicate that between piscivorous fish, marine mammals and marine birds, approximately 30,000 mt of herring is consumed each year. This is probably an underestimate since it was based among other things, on a presumed low abundance of herring on Georges Bank and herring, at least during the spawning season, are known to be much more abundant in recent years as the offshore portion of the stock has recovered. However, even using an estimate of 50,000 mt, this only represents 2.5% of the estimated total stock size of Atlantic herring in 1990, and 50% of the current commercial harvest. 

>Natural mortality rate estimates for Gulf of Maine herring at different ages (Anthony 1972) indicated that M increases from values of 0.2-0.3 at ages 1-3, then increases exponentially at older ages, reaching 0.8 at age 8. These estimates were based on the relative abundance of adult herring caught incidentally in other fisheries (e.g., bottom trawls) along the coast of Maine in the 1960s, at a time when the only demand was for juvenile herring. Total mortality rates estimated by this technique at that time were thus attributed entirely to natural mortality. This assumption is probably correct, but the rapid increase in M at older ages is illogical and contrary to results based on feeding rates (see above). It is likely that the decline in the catch rates of older herring was biased by an increasing ability of larger fish to avoid capture or to leave coastal areas where the catches were made in favor of deeper, offshore waters.

>On Georges Bank, Tsou and Collie (1997) estimated predation mortality rates on herring that varied from 1.2 (70%) at age 0 to 0.01 at age 5. The biomass of herring consumed by silver hake, dogfish, cod, haddock and winter skate varied roughly between 5,000 mt and 35,000 mt between 1978 and 1990. Predation mortality on the two principal prey species, herring and silver hake, was estimated to be much higher than fishing mortality and higher than the constant M=0.2 rate that is generally assumed.

Feels like no one really knows what's really going on here. 


#### Disease<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup> 

>The systemic fungus pathogen Ichthyosporidium hoferi has been known to cause large-scale mortalities of herring (Sindermann 1963, 1965). Herring may also be infected by the piscine erythrocytic necrosis (PEN) virus (Reno et al. 1978). A mass mortality of herring in the Bay of Fundy caused by a toxic dinoflagellate, Gonyaulax excavata, contained in pteropods and zooplankton, which had been consumed by the herring (White 1977, 1980).

>During the winter of 1969, a series of extensive herring mortalities occurred in the Placentia Bay, Newfoundland region. The dead herring were red in color (fins and body) and attracted much publicity. Mortality was first thought to be caused by a disease but was later shown to be the result of industrial pollution, mainly phosphorus, from a nearby industrial plant (Jangaard 1970).


#### Gear Types

> Mid-water trawlers deploy and tow a net in the water column to catch schooling fish such as herring. The large front end of the net herds schooling fish toward the narrow back end, where they become trapped.

> Purse seiners catch schooling fish near the surface by encircling them with a net. When the net is around the school, fishermen lift up a wire that runs through the bottom of the net, closing the “purse” from below.

#### Fleet Size<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup> 

> The fishery is dominated by a relatively small group of vessels, though a broader group of vessels lands some herring in small amounts (Table E.14). In 1997, nearly 98 percent of the landings were made by 21 vessels, and 10 boats accounted for 92% of the catch. This same year, only 61 vessels averaged more than 2,000 pounds of herring on trips that reported landing herring.

#### Environmental Changes

> https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/44/3/401/6562678

Warming might increase the presence of plankton in some cases, but may to such a degree that it starves fish of oxygen. 

We know that the Gulf of Maine is heating up very quickly. https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/ecosystems/current-conditions-northeast-us-shelf-ecosystem-spring-2022

Then there's eutrophication due to runoff - https://www.gulfofmaine.org/public/state-of-the-gulf-of-maine/eutrophication/

#### Processing<sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup> 

>  The herring is typically pumped into trucks that carry a combined mixture of herring and water, but are not cooled in any manner. For this reason, it is important the fish be landed soon after they are caught and transported as rapidly as possible. The typical truck is estimated to hold about 40,000 pounds (or just under 20 mt) of herring. 

> When herring are plentiful, one of the key problems facing fishermen is to obtain, and retain, a ready market for their fish. The introduction of IWP's, discussed below, was in part a response to find an additional market for herring fishermen. Many fishermen do not leave the pier without knowing who will buy their fish and how much they should deliver.

> The two major domestic processing markets for Atlantic herring are the sardine canneries and the bait market. At times, U. S. herring have also successfully competed in the foreign frozen fillet market to the European and foreign markets, but the last time this market was significant was in 1982. 

>An economic of the Maine sardine industry was conducted in 1982 (Hu et al. 1983). At the time of this review, 14 plants were operating in Maine, providing employment for 1,176 processing workers in 1980. The industry contributed $66 million to the Maine economy in 1980, about one third of the total estimated income contributed by the seafood processing industry to the state.
