#### Biological Range

> Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus harengus) are distributed along the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to the Canadian Maritime provinces. Schools of adult herring undertake extensive migrations to areas where they feed, spawn and overwinter. Herring are found all along the coast in inshore and offshore waters to the edge of the continental shelf during late winter and early spring. Adult herring move north into the Gulf of Maine in the spring, and in the summer and fall they segregate into more or less discrete spawning aggregations. After spawning, the adults migrate south again. This changing seasonal distribution has given rise to both mobile and fixed gear fisheries which harvest herring of all age groups. The catch supplies domestic and foreign markets for juvenile and adult herring which are used for human consumption, bait and food for zoo animals. Adult herring undertake extensive seasonal movements, which have been best defined for the Georges Bank stock. Three phases are apparent: (1) a late summer-early autumn spawning migration of ripening fish; (2) a rapid post-spawning migration to warmer waters to the south for overwintering; and (3) a spring-early summer feeding migration. The Soviets followed adult herring from Georges Bank after spawning. They found that post-spawners moved southwest to off Chesapeake Bay in November and overwintered there. The larger and older fish seemed to Atlantic Herring FMP and EIS 115 move furthest south. Feeding migrations back to Georges Bank began in May or early June, and to shallower spawning sites on the northern edge in September. The waters off Cape Cod seemed to constitute a mixing area, with different groups passing at different times of the year. <sup>[Management Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/atlantic-herring-management-plan)</sup>
